Interface Design Update: Mobile Game App - 'Challenge' Menu

Objective: Create an engaging and intuitive user interface for the 'Challenge' section of a mobile game app, which highlights three levels of evolution challenges.

Main Screen Layout:
- The screen is divided into three distinct sections, each representing a level of evolution challenge.
- Each section is visually distinct and clearly labeled as "Basic Evolution", "Intermediate Evolution", and "Advanced Evolution".

Level 1: Basic Evolution
- Objective: Evolve 5 common seeds into rare seeds.

- Engagement Count: "100 users joined".
- Deadline: "10 days left".
- Reward: A brief description or icon indicating the reward for completing this level.
- User Avatars: Three user profile avatars at the bottom, indicating the number of users who have joined this challenge.

Level 2: Intermediate Evolution
- Objective: Evolve 3 rare seeds into epic seeds.
- Progress Display: A card with a visual representation of rare seeds transforming into epic seeds.
- Engagement Count: "150 users joined".
- Deadline: "60 days left".
- Reward: A brief description or icon indicating the reward for completing this level.

- Reward: A brief description or icon indicating the reward for completing this level.
- User Avatars: Three user profile avatars at the bottom, indicating the number of users who have joined this challenge.

Additional Design Considerations:
- Each level should have a clear visual hierarchy, with the objective, engagement count, and deadline prominently displayed.
- Use contrasting colors or icons to distinguish between the levels and highlight progress.
- Implement a subtle animation or visual effect to show the evolution process when users interact with the cards.
- Ensure that the reward information is compelling and encourages users to participate.
- The user avatars should be interactive, allowing users to click on them to see more details or join the challenge.
- Include a call-to-action button for users to start or join the challenges.

Overall Aesthetic:
- The interface should reflect the game's theme and style, using appropriate graphics and color schemes.
- Maintain consistency in design elements across all levels for a cohesive user experience.

User Interaction:
- Users should be able to easily navigate between the levels and understand the requirements and rewards at a glance.
- Provide feedback when users interact with the levels, such as highlighting the selected level or showing progress updates.
